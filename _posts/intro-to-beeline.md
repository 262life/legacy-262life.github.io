# Quick and Easy guide to Beeline shortcuts for kubectl

I absolutely love opensource and believe 100% that it's the best way to develop software.  In the last few years I dedicated and invested much of my time in Kubernetes and containerization.  I love working with the command line. Seriously I don't thing there is a more effective way to interact in a computing environment for development, administration or just outright tinkering.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against UI/GUI and they are great in a pinch and a great way to familiarizse yourself with an application.  I use kubectl quite extensively and eventually the typing becomes a bit exhausing for repetive tasks.  There are lot's of extensions available for kubectl but I wanted to create something straight forward and easy to use and even extend if you want to.  It's called Beeline and it is a number of shortcuts and aliases for zsh and bash.  It was designed to use on the commandline comeplete with autocomplete and also in a bash script that is easy to read and follow for many procedural scripts like installing a helm chart.

This post will give you the same two minute introduction about Beeline and its possibilities, followed by the typical 10 minute hands-on guide to set up and get to know Beeline yourself. If youâ€™ve got 10 minutes to spare and finally want to be more proficient with Beeline: read on! Otherwise, if you already use zsh and aleady installed [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), just us the /quick primer/

## TLDR; This is the lazy version. . .
```
#####  Setup Beeline

## Defaults if you like
export KS_CONTEXT='cities'
export KS_NAMESPACE='kube-system'

[[ ! -f ~/.beeline.k8s ]]  \
&& curl -s -L https://github.com/262life/beeline/releases/latest/download/beeline.sh  > ~/.beeline.k8s

source ~/.beeline.k8s
##### End of Beeline
```

That's it.  Type kh to get a list of shortcuts.

## Full Installation

To use the shortcut scripts it is *required* that you have setup either bash or zsh completion in advance.  Beeline will enable kubectl's auto completion on your behalf.

### Installing ZSH 
This has been tested on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows WSL2.  

I highly recommend changing your login shell to zsh.  It is *now* the <span style="color:lightgreen">*macOS*</span> default.  For Ubuntu or WSL2, the following will install zsh.  If prompted, choose any defaults.

```
sudo apt install zsh
```

and to enable autocomplete for zsh on aly of the supported environments, install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) as follows:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

To enable these shortcuts you must source them into your shell.  This is dependent on the shell you are using.
You can either download the desired version you would like or if you are lazy like me do something like this if you use zsh:

```
#####  Setup Beeline

## Defaults if you like
export KS_CONTEXT='cities'
export KS_NAMESPACE='kube-system'

[[ ! -f ~/.beeline.k8s ]]  \
&& curl -s -L https://github.com/262life/beeline/releases/latest/download/beeline.sh  > ~/.beeline.k8s

source ~/.beeline.k8s
##### End of Beeline
```
Take note to edit the KS_CONTEXT and KS_NAMESPACE values to your liking.

Restart your shell and you should be good to go!  

Now, review the [usage documentation](https://github.com/262life/beeline/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) 


## Getting started with Beeline

At the heart of Beeline are the two most important and essential shortcuts; *kc* and *kn*.  These control the context of the session you are in.  Wait?  Did I say session?  kubectl sets the contexts in the config file and if multiple windows are open as the same user, it's shared right?  Well with Beeline that is not the case!  You can have multiple windows open or even multiple shells and the context stays with the current shell!  Cool right?

### About the config files

If you have a number of kubernete clusters to manage like I do, one of the more complicated aspects of kubectl becomes managing the config files.  This file can become long and extremely hard to read even for expert users.

Beeline takes care of this allowing you to keep a seperate config file for each cluster like this example:

```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: 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

```
As you can see, it's easy to read as a single YAML file therefore quote effect.  How do you make use?  Just add one or many of these files one for each cluster in your $HOME/.kube file and give it a .cfg extension and that's all you need to do.  Beeline will take care of the rest.

**note:  Do NOT remove the config file as it will be used as well.**
