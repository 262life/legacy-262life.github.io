Beeline integrates into your bash or zsh shell to provide a number of useful shortcuts as well as the ability to keep individual kubectl config files for each cluster. The makes mangaging the configs much easier to read and manage in the end.

For more details about the solutions currently supported by k8s_shortcuts, please refer to the project status section below. We plan to continue adding support for many common functions required based on community demand and engagement in future releases.
